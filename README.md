# Optimizing-Traffic-Signal-
#Objective
The goal of this project is to optimize traffic signal timings at various intersections in Bangalore using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. By dynamically adjusting green light durations based on traffic volume, the system aims to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.

#Technologies Used:
  Python (implementation)
  NumPy & Pandas (data processing)
  NetworkX (road network modeling)
  Matplotlib (visualization)

#ðŸ“Š Data Processing & Road Network Modeling:
 1.Traffic Dataset: Traffic volume data from intersections in 
  Bangalore is loaded from a CSV file.
 2.Graph Representation: The road network is modeled using NetworkX, 
  where nodes = intersections and edges = roads.
 3.Traffic Data Extraction: Each intersection is assigned a traffic 
  volume value from the dataset.

#ðŸ¦  Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Implementation:
  Particles Represent Traffic Signals: Each particle corresponds to a 
  set of green light durations (10s-60s) for intersections.
  Fitness Function: Measures the effectiveness of a signal 
  configuration (lower scores indicate better solutions).
Swarm Optimization Process:
  Particles update their velocity & position iteratively.
  Adaptive inertia weight (w) improves convergence.
  Best signal timings are selected after 50 iterations.

#ðŸ“ˆ Visualization & Results:
 Convergence Curve: Shows how optimization improves over iterations.
 Optimized Traffic Signal Timings: Displays final green light 
  durations for each intersection.
 Bar Chart Analysis:
   High-traffic intersections (e.g., Silk Board, Hebbal, Electronic 
   City) get longer green lights.
   Low-traffic intersections get shorter durations to optimize 
   efficiency.

# Key Takeaways & Future Improvements:
 âœ” Data-Driven Decision Making: Optimizes traffic signal durations 
   based on real-time conditions.
 âœ” Efficient & Scalable: Can be applied to more intersections and 
   real-time traffic updates.
 âœ” Potential Enhancements:
     Integration with live traffic data from sensors/CCTV.
     AI-based Reinforcement Learning for adaptive optimization.
     Simulation Testing in tools like SUMO (Simulation of Urban 
     Mobility).

# Conclusion:
This project showcases an AI-driven approach to urban traffic management, improving traffic flow and reducing congestion. By allocating green light durations based on demand, the system ensures smoother mobility and more efficient signal control!
